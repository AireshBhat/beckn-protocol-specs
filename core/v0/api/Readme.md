# How to build the specification

The full specification can be found at `core/v0/api/_build/resolved.yaml`

This is an autogenerated file created by compiling two sets of components namely,

1. APIs : found at `core/v0/api/components/io`
2. Schema : found at `core/v0/api/components/schemas`

The compilation flow is illustrated below



# Compilation steps

## Step 1 : Create the schema index file

- Go to the ```core/v0/api/``` folder
- Create a file ```_index.yaml```. If already present, open it in a text editor
- It will contain a list of schema with $refs pointing to specific schema files in the ```components/schemas/``` folder as shown below

```
Ack:
  $ref: "./components/schemas/Ack.yaml"
  
AddOn:
  $ref: "./components/schemas/AddOn.yaml"

...

```
- Ensure that each file in the ```components/schemas``` folder has an entry in this file. If it is not present, it will not be compiled


## Step 2 : Create the unresolved OpenAPI file

- In the same folder (`core/v0/api/`), create a file - `unresolved.yaml`. If it is already present, open it in a text editor.
- In the file, you will see the following

```
openapi: 3.0.0
info:
  title: Beckn Protocol Core
  description: Beckn Core API specification
  version: "1.0.0"

security:
  - SubscriberAuth: []
  - GatewaySubscriberAuth: []
paths:
  /search:
    post:
      tags:
        - Beckn Provider Platform (BPP)
        - Beckn Gateway (BG)
      description: BAP declares the customer's intent to buy/avail products or services
      requestBody:
        content:
          application/json:
            schema:
              $ref : "./components/io/Search.yaml"

      responses:
        default:
          $ref: "./components/io/Response.yaml"

...

```
- As you can see, the ```unresolved.yaml``` contains the unresolved Open API definitions with references to the APIs found in ```core/v0/api/components/io/```
- Ensure each API definition in the ```core/v0/api/components/io/``` folder is referenced in this file. If it is not present, it will not be compiled. 
- Once all API referencing is done, save this file and close it.

## Install swagger CLI

- Install the swagger command line tool using ```npm```
- Note: you may need to use root privileges if installing it globally

```
sudo npm install -g swagger-cli
```

## Generate the resolved OpenAPI definition file

- Go to the folder ```core/v0/api/```
- Run the following command

```
swagger-cli bundle unresolved.yaml --outfile _build/core.yaml --type yaml
```
- If the command runs successfully, you should see an output like this,

```
Created _build/core.yaml from unresolved.yaml
```
